## Background 

The [SB-79 Housing development bill](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB79) passed on 2025 June 3rd.

I'm no expert, but many have said this is a huge win for home development _and_
transit development by allowing more multi-family housing to be built near
transit stops (busses & trains). See https://cayimby.org/legislation/sb-79/

Excited Californians were talking about making sure to call up their senator
to thank them for voting yes. Although contact information is available on
https://www.senate.ca.gov/senators, I realized it wasn't easy for the typical
person to find their senator, find out how they voted on this bill, and then
how to contact them.

So that night I quickly threw together this interactive map. (Sorry the code & 
map are not perfect!) Feel free to take what's there for your own use!
